# Hyrum Paramore - Portfolio

My name is Hyrum Paramore and I am currently a student at BYU-Idaho studying Software Engineering. I love working with computers, building just about anything, and learning new ways to code. I do that by practicing with different projects and ideas that come to mind. I want to make it possible for others to see what I have worked on and developed during my college career and other projects that I have done in my spare time.

This repository is where I post links to the different projects that I have worked on and have accomplished. It is a place where you can see everything I have done in an easier view.
